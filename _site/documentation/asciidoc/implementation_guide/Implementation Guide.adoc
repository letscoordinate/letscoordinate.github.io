= Let's Coordinate - Implementation guide for Input and Output data


== Introduction
=== Purpose of the document

The objective of this Implementation Guide (IG) is to describe the format of input and output files to be used when dealing with Let’s Coordinate application. This can help developers to prepare input and output files adapted to a business tool that Let’s Coordinate will support for any RSC services. The implementation guide is one of the building blocks for using UML (Unified Modelling Language) based techniques in defining processes and messages for exchange between actors in the electrical industry in Europe. The implementation guide is developed for the harmonization of the underlying data exchange

=== Normative reference documentation

The following documents, in whole or in part, are normatively referenced in this document and are indispensable for its application. For dated references, only the edition cited applies. For undated references, the latest edition of the referenced document (including any amendments) applies:

* **IEC 61968-100 IEC** : 2018 Application integration at electric utilities – System interfaces for distribution management

* **ISO 8601:2014** : Data elements and interchange formats – Information interchange – Representation of dates and times

* **RFC4122** : A Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace Available from http://www.rfc-base.org/rfc-4122.html.

|===


== Input data format

Input data format is the same format for Informative and SMART notifications.
The only difference are linked to the data user wants to provide (text, RSC KPI, timseries...).

Two formats are proposed for input data:

* XLSX, Office Open XML worksheet sheet (OOXML), ECMA-376 standard file format, Microsoft Excel XML (2007+) file format
* JSON, JavaScript Object Notation, ISO/IEC 21778:2017 open standard file format (only encoded in UTF-8 and Unix Line Feed)

NOTE:

* M => Mandatory & this field is mandatory for XLSX and JSON files.
* O => Optional & this field is optional for XLSX and JSON files
* M(JSON) or O(JSON) => to be used only for JSON files
* M(XLSX) or O(XLSX) => to be used only for XLSX files

**Input file payload JSON sample file (with input data validation):**

link:attached_doc/json_payload_validation_input_file.json[JSON payload input file sample with input data validation]


== Output data format

Output data format is only used for SMART notifications as a result of a validation or coordination of some proposals received in the input file.
In case the input file is used for informative notification, no output file will be generated.

Two formats are proposed for output data:

* XLSX, Office Open XML worksheet sheet (OOXML), ECMA-376 standard file format, Microsoft Excel XML (2007+) file format
* JSON, JavaScript Object Notation, ISO/IEC 21778:2017 open standard file format (only encoded in UTF-8 and Unix Line Feed)

But this output format will be always the **same format** as the one received for input file.
(Ex: if Let’s Coordinate receives 1 input file in XLSX, then the output file will be also in XLSX)

NOTE:

* M => Mandatory & this field is mandatory for XLSX and JSON files.
* O => Optional & this field is optional for XLSX and JSON files
* M(JSON) or O(JSON) => to be used only for JSON files
* M(XLSX) or O(XLSX) => to be used only for XLSX files

=== Document header part

Header is the really similar as the one described for the input file with addition of:

* **Global field about the validation or coordination status** of the overall notification to be validated. This change is in the header of the output file.
** **CON(firmed):** the status of this notification is confirmed (based on the different answers done for each timeserie to be validated inside this notification)
** **REJ(ected):** the status of this notification is rejected (based on the different answers done for each timeserie to be validated inside this notification)
** **MIX(ed):** the status of this notification is mixed (based on the different answers done for each timeserie to be validated inside this notification)

=== Payload part

Payload is the really similar as the one described for the input file with addition of:

* **4 new fields** to validate differently each proposal/timeseries inside the notification:
** **accept:** if proposal is accepted
** **reject:** if proposal is rejected
** **explanation:** in case of rejection/refusal of the proposition to justify this choice from a list of values
** **comment:** about the validation or coordination of the proposal

Following table will describe **only** the part to be affected by these new fields for timeserie information (even if there are text information, RSC KPI information...).
