= User Manual

== Executive Summary
This document is the manual (user guide) of the Let’s Coordinate tool developed for RSC services that RSCs provide to TSOs, in order to present the main screens, functionalities of the tool and describe how to use the tool.

With this tool, user will be able to receive notifications to warn about relevant information linked to business processes (quality check report, results of calculation, free message…), to receive notifications to coordinate between TSOs and RSCs with dedicated screen to monitor and have a correct traceability of this coordination and to consult and export RSC KPI reports for these RSC processes.

== Introduction

=== User types

For the Let’s Coordinate application, we have 3 user types:

* Transmission System Operator (TSO),
* Regional Security Coordinator (RSC),
* Administrator (ADMIN).

Let see details about each of them:

==== TSO user
    
Each TSO is able to define a list of users among its entity to access to the tool within http://www.keycloak.org[Keycloak] authentication tool.
Each TSO has the possibility to interact with dedicated notifications only for its entity as TSO.
Each TSO authorized user is able to login to the tool, acknowledge notifications for its TSO for authorized RSC services, to answer to coordination requests and to monitor them, to consult KPIs for RSC processes and generate RSC KPI report.

==== RSC user

Each RSC is able to define a list of users among its entity to access to the tool within keycloak tool.
Each RSC has the possibility to interact with notifications for its entity as RSC and all received notifications related to one of the TSOs under its responsibility (without impacting the TSO notification itself).
Each RSC authorized user is able to login to the tool, acknowledge notifications for its RSC for authorized RSC services, to follow coordination requests from their TSOs and to monitor them, to consult KPIs for RSC processes and generate RSC KPI report.


==== Administrator user

In general, administrator (ADMIN) user has specific rights and can’t access to TSOs or RSCs data.
Some operations are restricted to users with the ADMIN role, either because they are administration operations with a potential impact to http://opfab.github.io/[OperatorFabric] or Let’s Coordinate instances as a whole, or because they give access to information that should be private to a user.

Below is a quick recap of these restricted operations:

* Users Service

** Any action (read, create/update or delete) regarding a single user's data (their personal info such as their first and last name, as well as their settings) can be performed either by the user in question or by a user with the ADMIN role.
** Any action on a list of users or on the groups (if authorization is managed in OperatorFabric) can only be performed by a user with the ADMIN role.

* Thirds Service

**	Any write (create, update or delete) action on bundles can only be performed by a user with the ADMIN role. As such, administrators are responsible for the quality and securi-ty of the provided bundles. In particular, as it is possible to use scripts in templates, they should perform a security check to make sure that there is no XSS risk.

IMPORTANT: The ADMIN role doesn't grant any special privileges when it comes to card consultation (be they current or archived), so an user with the ADMIN role will only see cards that have been addressed to them or to one of their groups), just like any other user.

=== Supported browsers

The tool is supporting the 3 most recent versions of these 3 following web browsers:

* Google Chrome, 
* Mozilla Firefox, 
* Microsoft Edge.

=== Supported OS

The tool is supporting only Windows as OS.
Other OS can be used but the compatibility with the 3 dedicated web browsers will not be guaranteed.

=== Default resolution
Default resolution of the GUI is HD 1920x1080.


== System login and logout

=== System login

When Let’s Coordinate has been installed on a specific server, to connect/log in to the Let’s Coordinate tool, user will have to use the Let’s Coordinate direct url to open directly the Let’s Coordinate tool: http://localhost/ui/.

After connecting to url address, user should enter its credentials: 

* Login : username or email
* Password

Then validate with “Log In” button.
 

After login, user will be redirected to the “Feed screen” of Let’s Coordinate which is the Home screen of the tool.

image::home_screen.png[Card Feed Screen]
 
The name (last and first names) and the entity (name of TSO or RCC) will be displayed on the right part of the header.

=== System logout

To log out, user can disconnect with a specific button on the top right part of the header of the screen. 
With the little triangle button on the right of username, user can click on it to display the content and then select log out.

image::menu_user.png[Log out]

After log out, user will come back to login page.

== Screens presentation

=== General screen overview

The proposed GUI for the application is common for all screens in the application. 

image::validation_notification_positive_with_warnings.png[Home Screen]

* On the top of the page, you have a header with
** Menu to access to the different screens of the tool.
*** **Card Feed screen** : to receive and display the different notifications. User will have the possibilities to manage the notifications in this screen.
*** **Card creation screen** : to create from the GUI some notifications and to send them to different users (TSO and/or RSC) or/and group of users
*** **Archiving screen** : to access to all existing notifications which are stored in the database
*** **RSC KPI report screen** : to configure and present the relevant Key Performances Indicators (KPIs) of the RSC services (graphs and report)
*** **Notification reception configuration screen** : to configure which notification user want to see or not. 

** Login information
*** In the top right of the page, you have the **name & company** of logged user
*** Below to the name of the logged user, **current time** for selected time zone of the day is displayed.

** User settings menu
*** *Settings screen* : to present the different settings for the user to be set (time zone, notification arrival with sounds…)
*** *Notification reception configuration screen* : to select which notifications to receive or not in the feed screen
*** *About* : to present the deployed version of the application
*** *Day mode* : to change from day to night modes or night to day modes
*** *Log out* : to log out from the application 

* Below the header, you have the content of the screen

=== Card Feed screen

The card feed screen is the place to receive and manage cards/notifications. 

image::home_screen.png[Card Feed Screen]

On this screen,

* Below the header, you have a timeline which presents when the events displayed in the notification are relevant.
* On the left of the page, you have the deck of notifications which presents all received notifications.
* On the right of the page, you have the detailed information of the notification.

==== Notification feed/deck consideration

**Global concept**

On the left part of feed screen, a deck presents all received notifications.

image::deck.png[Deck of notifications]

**Notification concepts**

Notification is an object which can support different operational information relevant for business process. Each notification has a "reduced view" to present a summary of its content, and a detailed view to see more about the notification.

There are 2 kinds of notifications which depends on the event to raise:

* **INFO**: for an information notification, user can just acknowledge it.
* **ACTION**: for an action/SMART notification when user should act (accept, reject, explanation about rejection and comment).

The color of the notification depends on the status of the card:

* **INFO** – blue : Information is received (like results of calculation are available)
* **COMPLIANT** – green : Validation has been performed successfully (like ACK is positive)
* **ACTION** required - orange – Warning : Please consider this notification and act to manage the raised situation/issue
* **ALARM** – red – Critical issues (like Process failed, validation failed)


They are 2 kinds of information inside an informative notification:

* **General information** : notification with a general information along the business period
** In such notification, a global information is applied for all business period without any specific timestamp identified
** Ex : Process success, process failed, input file positive validation…

* **Specific timestamped information** : notification with information for specific timestamps inside the business period
** In such notification, different information for dedicated timestamps are identified. Ex : 
*** Input file Negative validation => all severe errors, errors and/or warnings are detailed per timestamp
*** Input file Positive validation with warnings => All warnings are detailed per timestamp

**Arrival date and business period**

Each notification has an arrival date and a business period:

* **Arrival date** to know when this notification arrived in the system
** Example of arrival date : 19/09 13h23
* **Business period or validity period**: from when to when this information is relevant from business point of view. 
** Ex: If a process result notification arrives the 19/09 at 13h23 and concerns the Month ahead process (so for October), 
** Example of business period : 01/10 0h30 -> 31/10 23h30 included

**Notification View**

There are 2 views for a notification:

* **Reduced view** in the deck of notification
** Summary of the notification with limited information
** Depending if the card has been read or not, an eye cross out symbol appears on the right part of the notification
** Depending if the card has been acknowledged or not, a ticked symbol appears on the right part of the notification

image::ticked_ack.png[Acknowledged notification]

* **Detailed view** in the right part of the screen
** Presentation of the content of notification with detailed information
** In the detailed view, you can have different buttons to act on this notification.
*** In case of informative notification, you will be able to acknowledge/cancel acknowledgment of a notification:
       
image::negative_validation_opened_short_short.png[Detailed view]

*** (SOON) In case of SMART notification, you will be able to answer to some questions and then your answers to the coordination system.

**Read/Unread notifications**

A new notification when arriving in the deck is always an unread notification. User can recognize it by the bold weight of the reduced view content: 

image::notification_not_read.png[Read notification]

If a user clicks on the notification for the first time, then the notification will be changed to **read** status and the bold weight will disappear.

**Notifications arrival with sound**

User have the possibility to activate (or not) a dedicated sound bell when a new notification arrives. 
Each color/severity of notification has a different sound and an user can decide to active the sound for its arrival by ticking the corresponding check box:
 
image::sounds.png[Sounds activation]

**Deck display**

On the left part of feed screen, a deck presents all received notifications based on their business period displayed in the timeline.
Displayed notifications in the deck are the ones who are valid/active referring to the dedicated timeline view meaning: if at least one minute from business period (from businessDayFrom to businessDayTo) of the notification is in-cluded in the period presented in timeline view.
Some buttons are displayed on top of the deck to perform some ordering or filtering:

image::deck_buttons.png[Deck buttons]

**Deck ordering**

Notifications in the deck are sorted by default by "Unread then date" order.
User can decide to order the notifications in the feed by arrival date or by severity/color: 

image::ordering.png[Deck ordering]

**Deck filtering**

Some filters are proposed to filter the deck of card:

* Between 2 arrival dates

image::arrival_dates_filtering.png[Filtering by arrival dates]

* Based on the type/color of the notifications
** User can ticked or un-ticked notification color he wants to see : 

image::color_filtering.png[Filtering by color]

* Status of the notifications: Acknowledged/Not acknowledged with the following menu. User can select to see:  
** all notifications (acknowledged and not acknowledged)
** only acknowledged notifications
** only not acknowledged notifications 

image::ack_not_ack.png[Ack or not ack notifications]

By default, only “Not acknowledged” notifications are displayed: As soon as a user will acknowledge a notification, it will disappear from the deck based on this filter. 


==== Timeline consideration

**Global concept**

Below the header, a timeline is proposed.
This timeline represents a spatial view of information inside the notification depending on its severity/color, the event arrival or occurrence/relevancy.

image::timeline.png[Timeline]

**Different views**

To ease the view and to match with relevant timeframe processes, 
4 different zooms are proposed:

* **7 Day** view from D-1 0h selected time until D-7 selected time – Default view
* **Week** view from Saturday 0h selected time until next Saturday 0h selected time
* **Month** view from 1st of the month 0h selected time until 1st of next month 0h selected time.
* **Year** view from 1st January 0h selected time until 1st January of next year 0h select time.
* **>>** : to move to the next period 
* **<<** : to move to the previous period 

A specific button on the bottom right is dedicated to hide (or not) the timeline:

image::hide_timeline.png[Hide timeline]

When timeline is hidden, the considered business period (before it was hidden) is displayed on the left of its buttons.

For all first-time period view selection, the **selected period** will be preceded by the remaining days and hours between real time (current time) and begin of selected period (operational view). 

User can click on **>>** button to see the next period or click on **<<** button to see the previous period.
In case user was in the first-time period view selection, if user clicks on **<<**  or **>>**, then the timeline will be configured in study mode view: beginning and end of the period displayed in the timeline are referring to selected period (without representing real time if not inside the period).

**Time tick consideration**

Each time tick represents a specific date and hour. The information displayed in this tick is the information from this time tick and before the next one.

For example if the time tick is for the 11/10 0h with 7D view (a time tick every 4h in that zoom), user will see aggregated values from 00h to 3h59. And for the time tick of 11/10 4h, information from 4h to 7h59 etc…

“Real-time” time tick displays current hour and day. It’s marked as a bold blue time tick in the timeline if it is included in the timeline view/zoom. Before real-time time tick, some days or hours are displayed in order to present some events which just passed now in the past.

image::realtime_tick.png[real time tick]

**Bubble tips in the timeline**

Bubble tips are used in the timeline to present the number of notifications detected for the dedicated time tick per categories of notification (blue, red, green or orange).

image::bubble_tips.png[bubble tips]

Ex: Here 7 red notifications have been detected, 3 orange ones… for the period between the 1st of April and the 1st of June.

The way to spatialize a notification in the timeline depends on kind of notifications. 

* In case of general information notification (notification with a general information along the business period), this information will appear as a bubble in the timeline at the arrival date
** This information will appear in the timeline at the exact time/date when the notification arrived – when the global process/quality check has been done
** Ex: if a process success notification arrived at 9h53 24/06, then the bubble will be at this time/date.
* In case of timestamped information notification (notification with information for specific timestamps inside the business period), each information for dedicated timestamp will appear with a dedicated bubble in the timeline.
** Each event (error, warning…) inside the notification will be presented with a dedicated bubble in the timeline
** Ex : if inside a negative input file validation notification, error A is detected the 25/06 12h and error B is detected the 26/06 18h, then 2 bubbles are represented  : one for the error A and one for the error B at dedicated date/time.

**Visualization of content of bubble**

User can click on a bubble to see the details of events inside the bubble. A window will appear and present all summary of notifications considered in this bubble. If user selects one of the presented items, then the dedicated notification will be opened as a notification detailed view from feed screen.

image::bubble_selection.png[Bubble opening]


**Link between timeline view and notifications in the deck**

The timeline view affects the notifications in the deck as a kind of filter of them:

* Each notification in the deck has a business period (businessDayFrom – businessDayTo). 
* If the business period of notification is included in the timeline period (timeline from – timeline to), then the notification will appear in the deck. 
** It can happen that a notification is not represented in the timeline as its arrival date/hour is not included in timeline view but as its business period is still included in the timeline period/view, the notification stays in the deck of notifications.
* If the business period of notification isn’t anymore included in the timeline period/view, then the notification will be moved to archiving system.

**Logged username, current time and user settings**

In the right part of the header the following information is presented : the name (first and last name) of logged user, its company and the current time for selected time zone: With the little triangle button, user can click on it in order to open the "User settings" panel. In this menu, different screens are proposed to display the settings of this user  the "notification reception configuration" panel, information about the application version, to change the day/night mode or to logout.

image::menu_user_only.png[User menu]
 
* Settings at user level screen

In this screen, user can decide to change its time zone based on a proposed list of European cities: all hours in the tool will be updated referring to this time zone.

image::user_settings.png[User settings]

* Notification reception configuration screen

This screen displays a panel to select which notification user wants to see and receive or not.

image::notification_reception_configuration.png[Notification reception configuration]

* About screen

When selecting “About”, versions of deployed tools are displayed.

image::about_section.png[About section]

* Day/night mode

This functionality is used to change the color of the background of the tool by using a dedicated menu item:

* **Day mode** menu item to switch background to day mode with light colors

image::day_mode_menu.png[Day mode]

* **Night mode** menu item to switch background to night mode with dark colors

image::night_mode_menu.png[Night mode]

Example for the feed screen :

image::night_mode.png[Night mode]
image::day_mode.png[Day mode]

=== Archiving screen

This screen displays all past and currentreceived notifications. User is able to search among all notifications available by using filters based on:

* Service : name of RSC service (CGM, CSA, CCC, OPC, STA…)
* Process : list of sub item under the selected service
* State : status of the notification for selected service and process
* Tags : types of notificationto search notification by keywords
** RSC Process (CGM, CSA, CCC, OPC, STA…​)
** Kind of notification per process (CSA process success, CSA process failed…)
* Published date & hour of the notification : publish from and publish to
* Business period date & hour insideof the notification content : active from and active to

=== RSC KPI report screen 

This screen displays the relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for business processes.

It’s composed of two parts:

* **Configuration RSC KPI report screen** : This screen proposes settings to configure the report user want to see. When the settings are set, then click on “Submit” button to display the report. User can choose:
** Which RSC service ?
*** List of RSC service registered is proposed
** Granularity / Period : 
*** Granularity of the information : Daily or Yearly
*** Period : select the business period 
**** When granularity is Daily : from start day to end day 
**** When granularity is Yearly : from start year to end year 
** Which area (RSC or Region/CCR) is concerned?
*** User should decide to see the information per RSC or per Region/CCR but not together.
*** If granularity is Daily : user should select or “Pan-Eu”ropean to see the global value of this KPI or one of the RSC or one of the Regions/CCRs.If granularity is Yearly: user can select multiple choices in the same category: 
**** Pan Eu from RSC part + 1 or multiple RSC 
**** or Pan-Eu from Regions/CCRs + 1 or multiple regions/CCRs
** Which kind of KPIs?
*** Global performance (Pan European KPI which are not linked for any RSC or Region/CCR) and/or Business (KPI relevant for the concerned area : RSC or regions)?

image::RSC_KPI_config.png[RSC KPI config]

* **RSC KPI display screen** : In this screen all graphs about KPI based on user configuration will be displayed. For every graph, user can add a comment below the graph itself. User has the possibility to export the graphs with comments as a pdf report by clicking on the pdf icon or export data (data only without graphs) as an Excel report by clicking on the Excel icon at the bottom. In case of pdf export, comments will be displayed.

image::RSC_KPI_graphs.png[RSC KPI graphs]

== Tool functionalities

=== Notification management

**Notification reception**

A notification appears in the card deck and displays a bubble in the timeline (depending on type of card)

image::notification_never_open.png[Notification never open]

**Open a notification**

User can click on a notification in the deck to open the detailed content

image::notification_opened.png[Notification open]

**Acknowledge a notification**

With action buttons present in detailed view, user can act on the card (acknowledge it if card type is information or accept/refuse it if card type is action).

Ex : For informative notification, user is able to acknowledge the notification to keep track of its reading. After a performed acknowledgement, notification will disappear from the deck. The only way to see it again is to consult the Archiving screen or to update the default filter which only shows the “not acknowledged” notifications.
 
=== RSC KPI graphs and report

**Set RSC KPI graphs**

The user chooses the RSC service, the data granularity (daily or yearly), the period (starting and ending dates), the RSC or Region, and the KPI data type (Global performance and/or Business process):

image::RSC_KPI_config_details_daily.png[Set RSC KPIs]

**Selection of RSC service selection**

This selection allows to choose which RSC services KPIs should be displayed:

* CGM,
* CSA,
* CCC,
* OPC,
* STA,
* etc...

Only 1 service can be selected

**Data Granularity selection**

User should select the granularity of data. This to see the data with a daily granularity (one value per day if existing) or yearly (one value per year if existing).
 
**Period selection**

User selects the period from 1 day to 5 years. 

When data granularity is daily, we recommend to not use more than 1 year period.

**election of area : RSC or Region**

This selection will filter data for the concerned area : for one RSC or one Region/CCR, or general in case of Pan-EU (Pan-European).

* If granularity is Daily : user should select 
** or “Pan-Eu”ropean to see the global value of this KPI 
** or one of the RSC (not possible to select multiple RSC together)
** or one of the Regions/CCRs. (not possible to select multiple Regions/CCRs together)

* If granularity is Yearly : user can select one or multiple choices in the same category: 
** RSC category ; “Pan Eu”, 1 or multiple RSCs together
** or Region category : “Pan-Eu”, 1 or multiple Regions/CCRs together

**Data type selection**

Figures depends on selected type of KPIs:

* If global performances KPIs : no difference if user selects a RSC or all RSC, only global KPIs here,
* If business KPIs : these KPIs are different for each RSC or each Region/CCR as data are correlated to TSOs under responsibility of each RSC or TSOs linked to each Region/CCR.

**RSC KPI graphs in GUI**

User can see dedicated RSC KPIs graphs in GUI and can add some comments below each graph.

image::RSC_KPI_graphs_multiyear.png[RSC KPI graphs]

**Export KPI report**

The user can export KPI in pdf format by clicking on the dedicated button (pdf report will contain the comments if provided by user). It can also download report in xlsx to export only the values (no graphs).

=== Reception notifications configuration screen

Reception of the notifications is configurable for each RSC service.

image::notification_reception_configuration.png[Notification reception configuration]

For each RSC process, a specific menu allows each user to determine which notification he wants to receive: 

* If the notification is ticked, then user will receive it,
* If not, user will not receive it.

By confirming its choice with dedicated button, user will update its default settings. These settings will be applied directly in the feed screen.

=== Archiving system

User has the possibility to consult all received notifications in Archiving screen:

image::archive_screen_empty.png[Archive screen empty]

The screen is composed of 3 different components:

* Research parameters
* Found notifications list
* Detailed view of notification

**Research parameters**

User can decide to set up some filters or not and see dedicated cards by clicking on search button  

Different available filters are:

* Service = user can select the RSC service
* Process = user can select process related to selected RSC service
* State = user can select state for the selected process
* Tags = user can enter a keyword
* Published date & hour : 
** publish from = all notifications published from this date/hour
** publish to = all notifications published before this date/hour
* Business period date & hour : active from and active to
** active from = all notifications where business period is active at least in one hour from this date/hour
** active to = all notifications where business period is active at least in one hour from this date/hour 

image::archive_screen_full.png[Archive screen]

**Found list of notification**

List of notification found in the database will appears as a list. In case of multiple pages, user can change from one page to another one with dedicated buttons.

**Detailed view of notification**

User can open a notification in detailed view to consult them more in details by clicking on it.

=== Notification creation

The goal of this screen is to create a notification from Let’s Coordinate GUI and to send this notification to other users.

image:card_creation_preview.png[Card creation preview screen]

== Existing generic notifications

Depending on the business process, notifications will be different and adapted to each business process.

5 generic notifications are identified:

* **Process success** : This notification is emitted as soon as a process finished a step of the RSC process which was successful. This notification can present some files as process results to be downloaded. Color = BLUE.

image::process_successful_opened_short.png[Process successful]

* **Process failed** : This notification is emitted as soon as a process finished a step of the process wich was not successful or failed to finish the process step. This notification can present some files as process failure information to be downloaded. Color = RED.

image::process_failed_opened_short.png[Process failed]

* **Validation of input file** : This notification is emitted as soon as a validation of an input file has been performed by a business RSC/TSO tool and a dedicated ACK has been generated. There are 3 possibles results :
** **Positive validation** : in case the input file is correct. Color = GREEN

image::positive_validation_opened_short.png[Positive validation]

** **Positive validation with warnings** : in case the input file is correct but has some warnings. Color = ORANGE

image::positive_validation_with_warning_opened_short.png[Positive validation with warnings]

** **Negative validation** : in case the input file failed the validation as detected errors. Color = RED

image::negative_validation_opened_short.png[Negative validation]
